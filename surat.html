<p>Surat, famous for its diamond cutting and polishing is known as the Diamond City of India.</pstyle></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Surat is believed[by whom?] to have been founded by a Brahmin named Gopi, who named the area Surajpur or Suryapur.[20] In the 12th and 15th centuries, Surat was plundered by Muslims.[20] In 1512 and again in 1530, Surat was ravaged by the Portuguese Empire. In 1514, the Portuguese traveler Duarte Barbosa described Surat as an important seaport, frequented by many ships from Malabar and various parts of the world. By 1520, the name of the city had become Surat.[20]</p>
<p>In 1573, Surat was conquered by the Mughals.[20] It was the most prosperous port in the Mughal empire.[21] Despite being a rich city, Surat looked like a typical "grubby" trader's town with mud-and-bamboo tenements and crooked streets, although along the riverfront there were a few mansions and warehouses belonging to local merchant princes and the establishments of Turkish, Armenian, English, French and Dutch traders. There were also hospitals for cows, horses, flies and insects run by religious Jains, which puzzled travelers.[21] Some streets were narrow while others were of sufficient width. In the evening, especially near the Bazaar (marketplace), the streets became crowded with people and merchants (including Banyan merchants) selling their goods. Surat was a populous city during the Mughal era but also had a large transient population: during the monsoon season, when ships could come and go from the ports without danger, the city's population would swell.[21] In 1612, England established its first Indian trading factory in Surat.[20] The city was sacked twice by the Maratha king Shivaji, with the first sacking occurring in 1664.[20][10] Shivaji's raids scared trade away and caused ruin to the city.[21]</p>
<p>Later, Surat became the emporium of India, exporting gold and cloth. Its major industries were shipbuilding and textile manufacture.[20] The coast of the Tapti River, from Athwalines to Dumas, was specially meant for shipbuilders, who were usually Rassis.[10] The city continued to be prosperous until the rise of Bombay (present-day Mumbai). Afterwards, Surat's shipbuilding industry declined and Surat itself gradually declined throughout the 18th century.[20][10] Between 1790-1, an epidemic killed 100,000 Gujaratis in Surat.[22] The British and Dutch both claimed control of the city, but in 1800, the British took control of Surat.[20][10]

    By the middle of the 19th century, Surat had become a stagnant city with about 80,000 inhabitants. When India's railways opened, the city started becoming prosperous again. Silks, cottons, brocades, and objects of gold and silver from Surat became famous and the ancient art of manufacturing fine muslin was revived.[20]</p>
<h3>Economics</h3>
<p>Surat ranked 10th in India with a GDP of 2.60 lakh crore in fiscal year 2016 ($14 billion in 2010). Surat GDP in 2020 will be around $57 billion estimated by The City Mayors Foundation, an international think tank on urban affairs </p>
<p>Diamond polishing

    Diamond polisher
    Surat is a major hub of diamond cutting and polishing.[31] The first diamond workshops in Gujarat appeared in Surat and Navasari in the late 1950s. The major group working in this industry is people from the Saurashtra region of Gujarat. Because of demand in the American market from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s (with only a brief recession in 1979), Surat's diamond industry grew tremendously. Currently most of the diamond polishing workshops are running in the Varachha area of Surat, mostly by the people of the Patel community.[32]
    
    Around the world, 8 out of 10 diamonds on the market were cut and polished in Surat. This industry earns India about US$10 billion in annual exports. A legacy of old Dutch trade links, it began after a Surti entrepreneur returned from East Africa bringing diamond cutters. The rough diamonds are mined in South Africa and other regions of the African continent, and go from here as smooth gems to Antwerp, Belgium where the international diamond trade is run mainly by Hasidic Jews and Jains from Palanpur in North Gujarat.[33]</p>
<p>Textiles

    Surat's Textile District Ring Road
    Since it is known for producing textiles, including silk, Surat is known as the textile hub of the nation or the Silk City of India. It is very famous for its cotton mills and Surat Zari Craft. Surat is the biggest centre of MMF (man-made fibre) in India. It has a total of 381 dyeing and printing mills and 41,100 powerloom units. There are over a hundred thousand units and mills in total. The overall annual turnover is around 5 billion rupees. There are over 800 cloth wholesalers in Surat.[34] It is the largest manufacturer of clothes in India, and Surti dress material can be found in any state of India. Surat produces 9 million metres of fabric annually, which accounts for 60% of the total polyester cloth production in India. Now the city is focusing on increasing the exports of its textile.[35]</p>   
<p>Information technology
    There are many SME Domestic IT Companies present in Surat. MNC IT companies like IBM,[36] HCL have satellite or virtual branches in Surat. On 14 February 2014 Govt of Gujarat DST had handover STPI Surat[37][38] at Bhestan-Jiav Road, Bhestan Near Udhana-Sachin BRTS Route.
    
    Surat city administration will demand for setting up of an Information Technology (IT) hub and an Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) on the outskirts of the city.[39]
    
    Microsoft CityNext initiative has tied up with IT services majors Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro to leverage technology for sustainable growth of cities in India. The first smart IT city in India is being constituted by the Microsoft CityNext Initiative in Surat, Gujarat.[14] In 2011 Surat hosted India's first Microsoft DreamSpark Yatra (a tech event) with speakers from Microsoft Headquarters at Redmond, Washington. The event was organised by Ex-Microsoft Student Partner Samarth Zankharia.[40]
    
    In May, 2015 Tech giant IBM has chosen Surat among 16 global locations for its smart cities programme to help them address challenges like waste management, disaster management and citizen services. Under the programme, IBM will send a team of experts to each of the chosen cities where they will spend three weeks working closely with city staff analysing data about critical issues faced by its local bodies;[41][17] the co-operation continued into 2016.[16]</p>     
<p>Diamond Research And Mercantile City (DREAM)
    Main article: Diamond Research and Mercantile City
    The government of Gujarat plans another project near Surat similar to Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT). The Chief Minister has suggested that the government wishes to develop DREAM to have a five-seven star hotel, bank, IT, corporate trading house, entertainment zone and other facilities while the Surat Diamond Bourse (SBD) will be based there. Allotment of Khajod land for the project is convenient for the state government because they have 2,000 acres (810 ha) of available land. The Trade Centre, located near Sarsana village, will have a 100,160-square-metre (1,078,100 sq ft) pillar-less air-conditioned hall with a 90-by-35-metre (295 by 115 ft) pillar-less dome.[42][43]</p>
